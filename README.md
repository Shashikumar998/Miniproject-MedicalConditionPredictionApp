# Medical Condition Prediction Application


##### From ancient times to renaissance, it is seen that people do not take the issue of their health seriously and simply ignore it when it comes to maintain it to lead a good, happy life.The reason behind this ignorance can be different but the result is somewhat the same.The Medical Condition Prediction Android app will help user to view the scope of a disease in real time by selecting the current location of the user.The location selected are then processed to take out the chances of a disease to occur.There can be more than one disease predicted for a same location but may be with different percentage of chances of occurrence.The details of the disease are also given with useful information such as all the possible symptoms, detailed explanation of the disease and the next steps that are to be taken forward so as to prevent the disease without even going to any doctor or dispensary.The Medical Condition Prediction Android  app also creates an alert in regular time intervals after a certain prediction to ensure that whether the user has followed the steps provided post the diagnosis for ceasing the disease.
